## Prompt

Write a smart contract in PyTeal which has an input group of 2 transactions.

- Gtxn[0] is Asset transfer (ASA1) to the contract address
- Gtxn[1] is Noop app call - "DoSwap" with the following args...
    - [0] constant DoSwap
    - [1] ASA1
    - [2] ASA2
    - [3] POOL1
    - [4] POOL2
    - [5] ASA1_Amount

"DoSwap" will make the following inner txn calls

    - Inner Txn #1) call pact.fi POOL1 and pay ASA1 to receive ASA2.
    - Inner Txn #2) call pact.fi POOL2 and pay received ASA2 from previous tx and receives ASA1
    - Inner Txn #3) send ASA1 back to sender who initiated the "DoSwap" function
